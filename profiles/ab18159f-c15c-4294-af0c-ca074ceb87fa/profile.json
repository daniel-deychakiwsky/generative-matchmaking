    "summary": "Evelyn Sinclair is a 29-year-old woman from San Francisco, currently residing in Los Angeles, California. She speaks both English and Spanish and values hard work, kindness, and honesty. Fancying reading, traveling, and cooking, Evelyn works as a Software Developer in the technology industry, after graduating from the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nEvelyn describes herself as an agnostic and overtime, has assumed a liberal political stance. She's interested in monogamous relationships and is seeking a life partner. As a straight, white Caucasian woman who refers to herself with She/Her/Hers pronouns, she doesn't have any children yet but definitely wants them in the future. She is the proud owner of a dog and is an active Gemini INTJ who occasionally indulges in drinking but refrains from smoking or drug use.\n\nWhen it comes to a potential match, her preferences are quite clear. She would like to meet a straight man, aged between 28 and 35, who is at least as tall as her (5'8). Her potential partner should have no children but a willingness to have ones in future. Like her, he should be a non-smoker, not into drugs or marijuana, occasionally enjoys a drink, and keeps active.",
