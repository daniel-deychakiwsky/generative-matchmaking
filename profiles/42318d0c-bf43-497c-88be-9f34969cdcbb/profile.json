    "preferences_summary": "The user's ideal dating partner is a man who is between the ages of 29 to 36 standing within 5'6\" to 6'4\" in height. He should be someone without children but interested in having some in the future. The preferred partner may occasionally drink but should be a non-smoker, refrain from marijuana and drugs, and maintains an active lifestyle. His ethnicity can be Middle Eastern, White Caucasian, or from other groups. Politically, he should lean liberal or moderate. He should work in the fields of education, non-profit, or healthcare. An utterance of English is a foundational requirement. Making a long-term commitment is crucial, and he needs to share user's interest in travel, cooking, and yoga. Importantly, he values compassion, equality, and social justice similarly to the user. Desired educational attainment is either an undergraduate or a graduate level degree.",
