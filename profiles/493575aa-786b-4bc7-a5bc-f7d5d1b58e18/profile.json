    "summary": "Taylor Anderson is a creative and independent non-binary individual of Black African descent, looking for a life partner. The 27-year-old is a documentary filmmaker who highly values storytelling, traveling, and yoga. Fluent in English, French and ASL, Taylor was educated at Stanford University and is currently based in LA after originating from New York City.\n\nTaylor identifies as Buddhist, with liberal political views, and is keen on finding a partner who is comfortable with their preferences including occasional drinking, marijuana use, but no smoking or drugs. Fitness is important to them, hence an active lifestyle is a must-have characteristic for their ideal partner.\n\nIn the future, Taylor hopes to have children and envisions a harmonious family life with their beloved pets - a cat and some fish. Their ideal partner should be between 26 to 35 years old, with a height ranging from 5'5\" to 6'2\". Taylor prefers a partner who does not currently have children but wants to have them in the future. As an ENFJ and a Taurus, they are likely warm, outgoing, reliable, and possess strong values.\n",
