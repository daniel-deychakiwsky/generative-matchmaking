    "profile_summary": "The user is a 30-year-old graduate from the University of Miami, currently working in the technology industry as a software developer. She stands 5'6\" tall and resides in Los Angeles, California, originally from Miami, Florida. She speaks three languages which include English, Spanish, and Portuguese. She highly regards family, work-life balance, and fitness, with preferences for mountain biking, yoga, coding, latin dancing, and investing as ways to spend her time. Hailing from a Hispanic/Latino background, she identifies herself as a straight woman, leaning towards Catholic beliefs and a moderate political standpoint. She's keen on finding a life partner who aligns with her core values, wants children (although doesn't have any of her own at present), and believes in monogamy. She also engages herself in Elliptic Windows training on a regular basis to maintain her fitness. On the Myers\u2013Briggs Type Indicator, she is an ENFJ, a typically expressed style. She does enjoy a drink from time to time but doesn't use cigarettes, marijuana, or drugs. Amusingly, she loves her pet dog and launched her life under the star sign, Gemini. As compared to a life partner, she is very specific about what she's looking for.\n",
