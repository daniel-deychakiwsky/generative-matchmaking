    "profile_summary": "This profile belongs to a 29-year old man who goes by the pronouns \"He/Him/His\". With an impressive height of 6'1'', he is an adventure-loving software engineer in the technology industry. A graduate from Stanford University, he is intellectual and respect-driven. Based in Los Angeles, California, but a proud native of Chicago, Illinois, he speaks both English and Spanish and identifies as a moderate Agnostic Gemini of White-Caucasian ethnicity with INTP MBTI personality typology. He has a passionate interest in technology, hiking, photography, music, and craft beers. Welcoming monogamous relationships, he shows excitement about both short and long-term romantic possibilities. However, needing a partner who loves being active like himself is crucial. Aspects such as drinking find an approving nod in his lifestyle while smoking, marijuana, and drug usage see a stern no. Although currently without children, he looks forward to building a family that potentially includes pets. ",
    "preferences_summary": "The user is seeking a woman who is between 24 and 32 years of age, and stands anywhere from 5'2\" to 6'0\" tall. This potential partner should be a straight and monogamous individual, who does not have children but wants them in the future. An ethnicity of White Caucasian, Hispanic/Latino, East Asian, or Black African Descent is preferable.

She should also be working within fields such as technology, healthcare, education, or arts and entertainment. This partner should be comfortable with drinking, but should not smoke or use marijuana or drugs. Lastly, she must have completed at least an undergraduate level of education and should ideally be English-speaking. The user's intended dating dynamics range from long term relationships to short term ones.",
