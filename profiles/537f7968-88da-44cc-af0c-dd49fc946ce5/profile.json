    "preferences_summary": "The user is interested in a potential dating partner who is a straight, active man aged between 29 and 39, standing between 5'8'' and 6'5'' in height. He seeks someone who aims to have a life partner with a monogamous relationship type, just like her. The prospective partner should value honesty, equality, and kindness and have mutual interests in reading, hiking, and traveling. Educationally, the partner should possess a minimum educational level of undergraduate or graduate. Additionally, he should be a non-smoker who occasionally drinks but doesn't use marijuana or any kind of drugs. Comfortable in the arena of software like her and politically liberal, this person should communicate well in English and belong to the White Caucasian ethnicity, disinterested in already having children but desiring them in the future.\n",
