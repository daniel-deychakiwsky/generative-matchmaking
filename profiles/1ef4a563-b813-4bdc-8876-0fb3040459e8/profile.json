    "profile_summary": "The user is a 29-year-old Gemini woman of Middle Eastern ethnicity who uses She/Her/Hers pronouns. She's 5'6\" tall with a software engineering job in the Tech Industry. She holds a graduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley. Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, she now resides in Los Angeles, California. She is multilingual with proficiency in English and Spanish. Positivity traits like Empathy, Hard work, and Kindness are her values, and she's keen on music, coding, and hiking. Being Agnostic, she's inclined towards liberal political views. Honest intentions of finding a life partner and subscribing to Monogamy make her a potential date for someone looking for a serious relationship. She's straight and has no children but wants some in the future. She's a pet mom to a cat and fish. Her Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) reveals her personality to be ENFP. She drinks occasionally and stays completely away from smoking, marijuana, and drugs. Staying active and regular exercise is her mantra for health.",
    "preferences_summary": "The user is looking for a life partner who is a straight man, aged between 29 and 41, and in the height range of 5'8\"- 6'5\". Her potential match should have no children but want them in the future, and should be active and moderate in drinking. She prefers a non-smoker, or someone who doesn't use marijuana or drugs. The interaction should be based on monogamy. Ethnically, she is inclined towards East Asian, White Caucasian or South Asian profiles. She aligns politically with liberals and prefers those who are involved in the finance, education or law sectors. Regardless, it would be vital that they only speak English. Integrity-values like empathy, hard work, and kindness are significant, and she embraces interests involving reading, sports, and cooking. An adequate level of education for her prospective partner would be undergraduate or graduate.",
