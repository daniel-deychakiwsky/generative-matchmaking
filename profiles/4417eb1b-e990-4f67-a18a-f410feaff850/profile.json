    "summary": "Kofi Nkrumah is a 30-year-old Financial Analyst based in Los Angeles, California. Originally from Accra, Ghana, Kofi values education, family, and success. His various interests include traveling, cooking, reading, and soccer. While a Christian who leans politically moderate, he identifies as a straight man of Black African descent who uses the pronouns, he/him/his. \n\nThough he has no children, Kofi is interested in having some in the future. He enjoys the company of his dog, and in line with his personality type (ENTJ), he seeks a balanced lifestyle, actively exercising, but also indulging in the occasional drink. However, he does not smoke or use drugs. \n\nHis ideal partner would be a woman aged between 25-35. He hopes she would share his interest in a balanced lifestyle, staying active and practicing occasional drinking, but not smoking or using drugs. It would also be ideal if she doesn't currently have children but plans to in the future.",
