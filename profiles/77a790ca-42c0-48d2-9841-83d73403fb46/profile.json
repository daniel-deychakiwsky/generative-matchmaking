    "preferences_summary": "The user is interested in a woman who falls between the ages of 25 to 34 and stands between 5'4\" and 6'0\" tall. She should not have any children but it's crucial that she's open to want children in the future. She should identify as straight and be open to both long term and short term dating, in favour of monogamy. Additionally, regardless of her ethnicity or political stance, smoking and drug use are dealbreakers. Drinking and marijuana use are acceptable if occasional and sporadically. Interestingly, regardless of her occupation or languages she speaks, she should be fairly active. The ideal partner is at least an undergraduate and should prioritise values of respect, honesty and compassion. There are no restrictions on the partner's interests.",
