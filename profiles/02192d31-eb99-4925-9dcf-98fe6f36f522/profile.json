    "summary": "Kimani Brown, a 32-year-old Non-binary individual, resides in Los Angeles but was originally from Oakland. Kimani works as a Video Editor in the entertainment industry and holds a graduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley. Their interests include documentary filmmaking, listening to music, and adventuring outdoors. Though identifying as agnostic and politically liberal, Kimani places high importance on honesty, social equality, and compassion. They use They/Them/Their pronouns and speak English, Spanish, and Swahili fluently. \n\nAlthough Kimani doesn't have children, they sincerely hope to become a parent in the future. They love their cat, and enjoy healthy habits such as occasional drinking, not smoking, and being active physically. As a Sagittarius, and an ENFP from the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, they are keen on finding a long-term relationship that could also work out in a short time frame. \n\nThey are interested in prospective partners between 28 and 38 years old who also want children. Non-smoking is a must, but are flexible about their partner's drinking habits. Exercise and activity are also a preferred trait in a partner. As Kimani identifies as \"Other\" regarding sexuality, they're open to others identifying similarly.",
