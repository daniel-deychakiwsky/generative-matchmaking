    "summary": "Alex Hill is a 32-year-old man, working as a Financial Analyst in the Finance industry, based in Los Angeles, California. He graduated from the University of Cincinnati and identifies as a Buddhist with liberal political views. His interests are traveling, hiking, football, and cooking. Alex, who is of black African descent, identifies as gay and uses He/Him/His pronouns. He is a dog lover and does not have children, but wants them in the future. \n\nFitness is an integral part of his lifestyle, and he enjoys a drink now and then but doesn't smoke or use marijuana or other drugs. He's a Taurus and an ENTJ. Alex is looking for a long-term, monogamous relationship with a man aged between 28 and 36, who also wants children, is active, and doesn't smoke or use drugs. Drinking and a love for dogs would be a bonus. Alex would prefer his match also to identify as gay, aligning with his sexuality. He is multilingual and speaks English and Spanish fluently.\n",
