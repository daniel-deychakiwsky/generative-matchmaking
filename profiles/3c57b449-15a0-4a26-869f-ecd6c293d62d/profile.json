    "summary": "Eva Schmidt, a 28-year-old woman who identifies as straight, is looking for a long-term, monogamous relationship. She is a University of Chicago graduate who works in the tech industry as a Software Engineer. Currently residing in Los Angeles, Eva originally hails from Hamburg, Germany, and is fluent in both English and German. \n\nEva is a health-focused and active individual, fully committed to her fitness. She loves traveling, reading books, hiking, staying updated with technology, and dancing. Open-minded Eva holds liberal political views and identifies herself as an agnostic. She's into pets, too, as she has a dog.\n\nWhen it comes to her perfect match, Eva is ideally looking for a straight man between the ages of 27 and 35, at least '5''8' high. She desires a partner who does not have children but does want them in the future - much like her. A match who leads an active lifestyle (like she does), and does not engage in smoking or drug usage will get her more interested. Moderate drinking is acceptable.\n\nEva is an Aries, with an INTJ personality type according to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. Lastly, she appreciates honesty and compassion in others.",
