    "profile_summary": "The user is a 28-year-old woman who identifies with she/her/hers pronouns and is straight. She is Hispanic/Latino, hailing from Houston, Texas, but she's currently looking to date in Los Angeles, California. As a Physician Assistant in the Healthcare industry she's ambitious and dedicated, and befits her Graduate-level education at the University of Southern California. She places high importance on values such as honesty, empathy, ambition, and social justice. She speaks two languages- English and Spanish. Despite being agnostic and having liberal political views, she enjoys hiking, traveling, photography, and cooking when she's not working. Currently, she has a dog and though she doesn't have children, she would love to have them in the future. She identifies as an ENFJ per her MBTI and a Leo as her zodiac sign. She is an active person who, on occasion, likes a drink, but is strictly against smoking, marijuana, and other drugs. She is looking for a long-term monogamous relationship, translating to a hopeful yes for kids in the future.",
    "preferences_summary": "The user is seeking a man between the ages of 27 and 35 who is active, does not have children but wants them, and ideally is within a height range of 5'7\" to 6'3\". The ideal partner would be straight, does not smoke nor uses marijuana or drugs, and consumes alcohol occasionally. He prefers a man that echoes her political stance on being liberal or moderate and shares similar ethnic backgrounds like White Caucasian, Black African Descent, Hispanic/Latino, Middle Eastern, Native American, Pacific Islander, South Asian, and Southeast Asian. Her future partner should have a profession within healthcare, education, technology, art, or engineering. Fluency in English and Spanish languages, sharing values of honesty, empathy, ambition, and social justice, intrigued in the same interests such as hiking, reading, adventure sports, music, attending functions, understanding photography and has an undergraduate or graduate degree would be plus points. A long-term, monogamous relationship is what she is intending.",
