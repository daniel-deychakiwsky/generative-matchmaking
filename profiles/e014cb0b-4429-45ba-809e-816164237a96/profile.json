    "profile_summary": "Our user is a 28-year-old woman who leans liberal politically, and identifies as an atheist. She works in the tech industry as a Software Engineer. She hails from Sacramento, California, but is currently living and looking to date in Los Angeles. Standing at 5'6\", she happens to be a fan of exercise keeping her figure quite active. She holds degrees from the prestigious University of California, Los Angeles and identifies as a straight white caucasian woman, employing 'She/Her/Hers' as her pronouns. Speaking two languages, English and Spanish, she embraces a life of honesty, loyalty, and kindness, while revelry rarely scanner who charts her goals. Her Myers-Briggs Type Indicator reveals her as an INFP (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving). For hobbies, she's into traveling, reading and likes hiking too. She favours a life of calm; no smoking, perhaps drinks occasionally, and definitely not partaking in marijuana or drugs. She likes the companionship of her cat and being without children does not prevent her from potential intentions of having some in the future. Interestingly, as a Leo, she unmistakably chases substance over pomp, seeking a long term relationship with an emphasis on monogamy. The world just might need these amusing, yet virtuous rebels of tradition.",
