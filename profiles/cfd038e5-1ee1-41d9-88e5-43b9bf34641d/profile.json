    "profile_summary": "Our user is a 29-year-old woman, identifying as straight, using She/Her/Hers pronouns. She stands 5'6\" tall hailing originally from Hamburg, Germany but currently looking for companionship in Los Angeles, California. Professionally, she's an Information Technology orientated Software Developer. She boasts about her accomplishment as a graduate from the University of Hamburg. Being bilingual, she can comfortably converse in English and German. Furthermore, honesty, kindness, and healthy living reflect her core values. In leisure, she often enjoys reading, hiking, coding, and has a passion for photography. She follows the Agnostic belief and prefers staying moderate in politics. Her sole intention revolves around a long-term relationship intending towards monogamy. For ancestry, she acknowledges her White Caucasian ethnicity. While the dog is her only non-human companion, she does anticipate having human children in the future. Identifying with the Pisces zodiac sign, her INTJ type hints at her introvert-driven, intuitive, probably thinking, and judging self. Advocating a balanced lifestyle, she is very active physically, but responsibly indulges in alcohol occasionally without leaning towards smoking or substance use.\n",
