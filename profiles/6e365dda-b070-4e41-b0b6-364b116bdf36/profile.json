She is bilingual, speaking both English and Spanish, powers her everyday conversations. She fancies a simple life, surrounded by family, and focuses on maintaining a work-life balance while aiming for her ambitions.

She takes lifestyle and fitness seriously, keeping herself active, and is seeking to have children someday with a Kindred partner, respecting her choice for long term monogamous relationships.
