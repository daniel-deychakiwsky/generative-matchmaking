    "summary": "Aliyah Sanchez is a 28-year-old software engineer based in Los Angeles, originally from Austin, Texas. She holds a graduate degree from the University of California, Los Angeles and is well-versed in English, Spanish, and Mandarin. Aliyah values honesty, respect, compassion, and innovation. She enjoys computer programming, hiking, music, cooking, and volunteering in her community. \n\nShe expresses herself as a spiritual woman who aligns with liberal political beliefs. Her dating intentions are more serious as she is looking for a long-term, monogamous relationship. Although she currently does not have kids, she is open to having them in the future. A proud owner of a dog and a cat, Aliyah is an active individual who occasionally enjoys a drink, but refrains from smoking and drug use. \n\nAs an Aquarius with an ENTP personality type, she is seeking a partner between the ages of 27 and 35 who does not have children but would like to in the future. This potential partner should not smoke, use drugs, or marijuana, but occasional drinking and an active lifestyle would be a plus.",
